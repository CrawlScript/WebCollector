/**
 * This is part of the URL Meta plugin. It is designed to enhance the NUTCH-655
 * patch, by doing two things: 1. Meta Tags that are supplied with your Crawl
 * URLs, during injection, will be propagated throughout the outlinks of those
 * Crawl URLs. 2. When you index your URLs, the meta tags that you specified
 * with your URLs will be indexed alongside those URLs--and can be directly
 * queried, assuming you have done everything else correctly.
 * 
 * The flat-file of URLs you are injecting should, per NUTCH-655, be
 * tab-delimited in the form of:
 * 
 * [www.url.com]\t[key1]=[value1]\t[key2]=[value2]...[keyN]=[valueN]
 * 
 * Be aware that if you collide with keywords that are already in use (such as
 * nutch.score/nutch.fetchInterval) then you are in for some unpredictable
 * behavior.
 * 
 * Furthermore, in your nutch-site.xml config, you must specify that this plugin
 * is to be used (1), as well as what (2) Meta Tags it should actively look for.
 * This does not mean that you must use these tags for every URL, but it does
 * mean that you must list _all_ of meta tags that you have specified. If you
 * want them to be propagated and indexed, that is.
 * 
 * 1. As of Nutch 1.2, the property "plugin.includes" looks as follows:
 * <value>protocol-http|urlfilter-regex|parse-(text|html|js|tika|rss)|index
 * -(basic|anchor)|query-(basic|site|url)|response-(json|xml)|summary-basic
 * |scoring-opic|urlnormalizer-(pass|regex|basic)</value> You must change
 * "index-(basic|anchor)" to "index-(basic|anchor|urlmeta)", in order to call
 * this plugin.
 * 
 * 2. You must also specify the property "urlmeta.tags", who's values are
 * comma-delimited <value>key1, key2, key3</value>
 * 
 * TODO: It may be ideal to offer two separate properties, to specify what gets
 * indexed versus merely propagated.
 *
