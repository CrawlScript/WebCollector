/**
 * This class represents the last part of the host name, 
 * which is operated by authoritives, not individuals. This information 
 * is needed to find the domain name of a host. The domain name of a host
 * is defined to be the last part before the domain suffix, w/o subdomain 
 * names.  As an example the domain name of <br><code> http://lucene.apache.org/ 
 * </code><br> is <code> apache.org</code>   
 * <br>
 * This class holds three fields,  
 * <strong>domain</strong> field represents the suffix (such as "co.uk")
 * <strong>boost</strong> is a float for boosting score of url's with this suffix
 * <strong>status</strong> field represents domain's status
